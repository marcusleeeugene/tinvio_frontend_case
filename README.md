Some notes to reviewer:
* I downloaded an external image of a phone I found as the icon-24-phone.svg in the assets folder was corrupted.
* I could not spend more time in perfecting it, as I have many school submissions to complete in the next few days as well.

If I have more time, I would love to do the following:
- Add in a visual loader for data loading 
- Learnt and used Redux for state management
- Created my own "cards" instead of relying on bootstrap's
