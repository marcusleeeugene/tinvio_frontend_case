Some notes to reviewer:
* I downloaded an external image of a phone I found as the icon-24-phone.svg in the assets folder was corrupted.
* Could not spend more time in perfecting it, as I have school submissions to complete in the next 2 days.
If I have more time, I would love to have added in a visual loader for data loading and created my own "cards" instead of relying on bootstrap's.
